## Technical Specifications (Phaser 3)

### Core Systems

class ReelSystem {
  constructor(config) {
    this.numReels = config.numReels || 5;
    this.symbolsPerReel = config.symbolsPerReel || 3;
    this.symbols = config.symbols; // Array of symbol definitions
    this.paylines = config.paylines; // Array of payline patterns
  }
  
  spin() {
    // Generate random results with weighted probabilities
    // Animate reel spinning (tween or timeline)
    // Check for winning combinations
    // Trigger win celebrations
  }
  
  calculateWeightedRandom() {
    // Higher value symbols = lower probability
    // RTP (Return to Player) = 95% target
  }
}
```

#### 2. Prize Wheel System
```javascript
class PrizeWheel {
  constructor(segments, center) {
    this.wheel = this.scene.add.sprite(center.x, center.y, 'wheel');
    this.pointer = this.scene.add.sprite(center.x, center.y - radius, 'pointer');
    this.segments = segments; // 24 segments with prize data
  }
  
  spin() {
    // Random target rotation (720° + random offset)
    // Physics-based deceleration
    // Sound effects (clicking per segment)
    // Stop on target segment ± tolerance
    // Trigger prize award
  }
}
```

#### 3. Currency/Economy System
```javascript
class EconomyManager {
  constructor() {
    this.coins = 1000; // Starting currency
    this.spinsRemaining = 3; // Free spins
    this.level = 1;
    this.xp = 0;
  }
  
  placeBet(amount) {
    // Deduct coins or use free spin
  }
  
  awardWin(multiplier) {
    // Calculate payout: bet * multiplier
    // Add XP: win amount / 10
    // Check level up
  }
  
  addFreeSpins(count, reason) {
    // Daily bonus, achievements, etc.
  }
}
```

#### 4. Collection/Achievement System
```javascript
class ProgressionManager {
  constructor() {
    this.collections = {}; // Tool sets
    this.badges = {}; // Achievements
    this.dailyChallenges = [];
  }
  
  trackSymbolCollection(symbol) {
    // Add to appropriate collection
    // Check if set complete
    // Award set bonus
  }
  
  checkAchievements() {
    // Evaluate unlock conditions
    // Award badges and bonuses
  }
}
```
