- **Typography**:
  - Headers: Bold, speed-inspired (Eurostile, Bank Gothic)
  - Body: Clear sans-serif (Roboto)

   - **Bottom Left**: Speedometer, fuel gauge, damage indicator
   - **Bottom Right**: Mini-map, next waypoint arrow
   - **Center**: Large directional arrow when near destination
   - Clean, non-intrusive design (doesn't block view)

4. **Effects**:
   - **Speed lines**: When traveling fast
   - **Screen shake**: On collision/landing
   - **Slow-motion**: During epic jumps or near-misses
   - **Glow/highlight**: Around collectibles and waypoints

## Technical Specifications (Phaser 3)

### Core Systems

#### 1. Vehicle Physics System
```javascript
class VehicleController {
  constructor(scene, vehicleData) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.body = scene.matter.add.sprite(x, y, vehicleData.sprite);
    this.stats = {
      speed: vehicleData.speed,
      acceleration: vehicleData.accel,
      handling: vehicleData.handling,
      suspension: vehicleData.suspension
    };
    this.velocity = { x: 0, y: 0 };
    this.fuel = 100;
    this.damage = 0;
  }
  
  update(delta, controls) {
    // Apply acceleration
    if (controls.accelerate) {
      this.velocity.x += this.stats.acceleration * delta;
    }
    // Apply braking
    if (controls.brake) {
      this.velocity.x *= 0.95;
    }
    // Steering
    if (controls.left || controls.right) {
      this.body.setAngle(angle + steerAmount);
    }
    // Apply velocity to Matter body
    this.body.setVelocity(this.velocity.x, this.velocity.y);
    
    // Fuel consumption
    this.fuel -= delta * 0.01;
    
    // Camera follow
    this.scene.cameras.main.scrollX = this.body.x - 400;
  }
  
  collision(obstacle) {
    const impact = calculateImpact(this.velocity, obstacle.mass);
    this.damage += impact;
    if (this.damage >= 100) {
      this.destroy();
    }
  }
  
  boost() {
    if (this.boostCharges > 0) {
      this.velocity.x *= 1.5;
      this.boostCharges--;
      // Visual/audio feedback
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Delivery & Waypoint System
```javascript
class DeliveryManager {
  constructor(levelData) {
    this.waypoints = levelData.waypoints; // Array of {x, y, type, reward}
    this.currentWaypoint = 0;
    this.completedDeliveries = 0;
    this.totalTime = levelData.timeLimit;
    this.currentTime = this.totalTime;
  }
  
  update(delta, vehiclePos) {
    this.currentTime -= delta;
    
    // Check if vehicle reached waypoint
    const wp = this.waypoints[this.currentWaypoint];
    if (Phaser.Math.Distance.Between(vehiclePos.x, vehiclePos.y, wp.x, wp.y) < 50) {
      this.deliverPackage(wp);
    }
    
    // Check fail conditions
    if (this.currentTime <= 0) {
      this.levelFailed('time_expired');
    }
  }
  
  deliverPackage(waypoint) {
    this.completedDeliveries++;
    this.scene.scoreManager.addPoints(waypoint.reward);
    
    // Visual feedback
    this.scene.showDeliveryAnimation(waypoint);
    
    // Advance to next waypoint
    this.currentWaypoint++;
    if (this.currentWaypoint >= this.waypoints.length) {
      this.levelComplete();
    }
  }
  
  levelComplete() {
    const timeBonus = this.currentTime / this.totalTime;
    const stars = this.calculateStars(timeBonus, damage, deliveries);
    this.scene.showVictoryScreen(stars);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Terrain & Obstacles System
```javascript
class TerrainManager {
  constructor(scene, levelData) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.obstacles = [];
    this.spawnObstacles(levelData.obstacles);
    this.terrain = this.createTerrain(levelData.terrainType);
  }
  
  createTerrain(type) {
    // Generate procedural or load tilemap
    // Apply physics properties (friction, bounce)
    // Ice = low friction, dirt = medium, asphalt = high
  }
  
  spawnObstacles(obstacleData) {
    obstacleData.forEach(obs => {
      const obstacle = this.scene.matter.add.sprite(obs.x, obs.y, obs.sprite);
      obstacle.setStatic(true);
      obstacle.setData('damage', obs.damageValue);
      this.obstacles.push(obstacle);
    });
  }
  
  updateDynamic(delta) {
    // Move traffic vehicles
    // Animate hazards (falling rocks, etc.)
  }
}
```

#### 4. Scoring & Combo System
```javascript
class ScoreManager {
  constructor() {
    this.score = 0;
    this.combo = 1; // Multiplier
    this.comboTimer = 0;
    this.comboThreshold = 3000; // 3 seconds to maintain combo
  }
  
  update(delta) {
    if (this.comboTimer > 0) {
      this.comboTimer -= delta;
      if (this.comboTimer <= 0) {
        this.resetCombo();
      }
    }
  }
  
  addPoints(basePoints, action) {
    const points = basePoints * this.combo;
    this.score += points;
    
    // Refresh combo timer
    this.comboTimer = this.comboThreshold;
    
    // Increase combo on consecutive actions
    if (action === 'near_miss' || action === 'air_time' || action === 'delivery') {
      this.increaseCombo();
    }
    
    // Show floating text
    this.scene.showPointsPopup(points, action);
  }
  
  increaseCombo() {
    this.combo = Math.min(this.combo + 0.5, 10); // Max 10x
  }
  
  resetCombo() {
    this.combo = 1;
  }
}
```

#### 5. Upgrade & Progression System
```javascript
class UpgradeManager {
  constructor(player) {
    this.player = player;
    this.vehicles = [
      { id: 'van', unlocked: true, upgrades: { engine: 0, suspension: 0, tires: 0, fuel: 0, cargo: 0, armor: 0 } },
      { id: 'pickup', unlocked: false, unlockLevel: 5, upgrades: {...} },
      // ...
    ];
    this.currentVehicle = this.vehicles[0];
  }
  
  upgradeVehicle(vehicleId, component) {
    const vehicle = this.vehicles.find(v => v.id === vehicleId);
    const currentLevel = vehicle.upgrades[component];
    const cost = this.calculateUpgradeCost(component, currentLevel);
    
    if (this.player.currency >= cost) {
      this.player.currency -= cost;
      vehicle.upgrades[component]++;
      this.applyUpgrade(vehicle, component);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
  
  applyUpgrade(vehicle, component) {
    // Modify vehicle stats based on upgrade level
    const level = vehicle.upgrades[component];
    switch(component) {
      case 'engine':
        vehicle.stats.speed += level * 5;
        vehicle.stats.acceleration += level * 2;
        break;
      case 'suspension':
        vehicle.stats.handling += level * 3;
        break;
      // ...
    }
  }
  
  unlockVehicle(vehicleId) {
    const vehicle = this.vehicles.find(v => v.id === vehicleId);
    if (this.player.level >= vehicle.unlockLevel && this.player.currency >= vehicle.unlockCost) {
      this.player.currency -= vehicle.unlockCost;
      vehicle.unlocked = true;
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
}
```

## PRD Summary

**Core Courier: Diamond Tools Delivery Force** combines the adrenaline of arcade racing with the satisfaction of mission-based progression, all wrapped in DMI's industrial brand identity. Players pilot DMI-branded vehicles—from nimble delivery vans to monstrous all-terrain trucks—across 30 challenging levels spanning urban streets, mountain passes, desert quarries, and coastal harbors. The objective: deliver DMI's diamond core drilling equipment to construction sites before time runs out, earning currency to upgrade vehicles and unlock new rides.

The gameplay loop balances accessibility and skill mastery. Simple controls (accelerate, steer, brake, boost) make it easy to pick up, but achieving 3-star ratings requires precision driving, combo chaining (near-misses, air time, speed bonuses), and route optimization. Physics-based vehicle handling adds depth—ice patches reduce traction, ramps launch you airborne, and cargo can fall off if you drive too recklessly. Upgrades provide tangible progression: a better engine increases speed, improved suspension smooths rough terrain, and a larger fuel tank extends your range. Collection mechanics encourage completionism: deliver all DMI product types to unlock catalog entries that educate players about real tools.

From a marketing perspective, Core Courier delivers passive brand immersion. Every vehicle bears DMI logos, every package showcases product names, and every level features DMI equipment in the environment. The game doesn't feel like an ad because the branding is organic to the setting. Real-world rewards—discount codes at level milestones, free shipping vouchers for weekly challenges—bridge gameplay to commerce. Trade show deployment transforms booth traffic: high-score competitions draw crowds, winners receive prizes, and the visible excitement generates social proof. Built on Phaser 3, the game achieves smooth 60 FPS performance on mobile and web, with Matter.js physics providing satisfying vehicle dynamics. Core Courier isn't just a fun game—it's a strategic marketing asset that keeps DMI top-of-mind for contractors, gamifies customer loyalty, and turns brand awareness into an exhilarating race.
