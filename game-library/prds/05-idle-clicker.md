## DMI Theme Concept

### Title: **"Diamond Empire: DMI Tycoon"**

### Tagline
*"From garage startup to global diamond tool conglomerate. Build the DMI Empire!"*

### Player Role
**DMI Tools Corp CEO** starting with a single diamond core drill in a garage workshop. Your mission is to grow the company into a multi-billion dollar global empire by manufacturing and selling premium diamond tools—core bits, blades, grinding equipment, and specialty diamond products.

### Story Hook
In 1974, Diamond Manufacturing Incorporated was just a dream in a dusty garage with one used core drill and a vision. Fast forward to today—you're the new CEO tasked with building the DMI empire from humble beginnings to global market dominance. Start by manually operating the drill to produce your first core samples, then reinvest profits into better equipment, hire skilled operators, expand into new product lines, and eventually dominate the global diamond tool market. Every tap represents a drill strike. Every dollar earned builds your empire. Can you make DMI the world's largest diamond tool manufacturer?

    let totalOfflineEarnings = 0;
    
    this.businesses.forEach(business => {
      totalOfflineEarnings += business.calculateOfflineEarnings(offlineSeconds);
    });
    
    // Show welcome back popup

      this.currency += totalOfflineEarnings;
      this.lifetimeEarnings += totalOfflineEarnings;
    }
  }
}
```

  }
}

loadGameData() {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('dmi-tycoon-save');

    this.id = config.id;
    this.name = config.name;
    this.description = config.description;
    this.cost = config.cost;
    this.type = config.type; // 'business', 'global', 'tap'
    this.target = config.target; // Which business or 'all'
    this.effect = config.effect;
    this.purchased = false;
  }
  
  canAfford() {
    return game.currency >= this.cost;
  }
  
  purchase() {
    if (!this.purchased && this.canAfford()) {
      game.currency -= this.cost;
      this.purchased = true;
      this.applyEffect();
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
  
  applyEffect() {
    switch (this.type) {
      case 'business':
        const business = game.getBusiness(this.target);
        business.upgrades.push(this);
        break;
      case 'global':
        game.globalMultiplier *= (1 + this.effect.multiplier);
        break;
      case 'tap':
        game.tapMultiplier *= (1 + this.effect.multiplier);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. Prestige System
```javascript
calculateAngelInvestors() {
  // Formula: sqrt(lifetimeEarnings / 1 quadrillion)
  const baseInvestors = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(this.lifetimeEarnings / 1e15));
  return Math.max(0, baseInvestors - this.prestigeCount);
}

prestige() {
  const newInvestors = this.calculateAngelInvestors();
  
  if (newInvestors <= 0) {
    this.showNotification('Not enough lifetime earnings to attract investors yet!');
    return;
  }
  
  // Confirmation dialog
  this.showPrestigeConfirmation(newInvestors, () => {
    // Reset game state
    this.currency = 0;
    this.businesses.forEach(b => {
      b.count = 0;
      b.manager = null;
      b.upgrades = [];
    });
    
    // Apply prestige bonuses
    this.prestigeCount += newInvestors;
    this.globalMultiplier = 1 + (this.prestigeCount * 0.02);
    
    // Award premium currency
    this.pinkDiamonds += Math.floor(newInvestors / 10);
    
    // Save and reload
    this.saveGame();
    this.scene.restart();
  });
}
```

## PRD Summary

**Diamond Empire: DMI Tycoon** brings the compulsive "just one more upgrade" loop of idle/clicker games into the world of diamond tool manufacturing. Players start as a garage entrepreneur with a single core drill and grow into the CEO of a multi-billion dollar global empire. The core gameplay loop is deceptively simple: tap the drill to earn money, buy business units that auto-generate more income, purchase upgrades and managers to increase efficiency, then prestige for permanent multipliers and start again stronger. This loop creates exponential growth curves that are psychologically rewarding—players constantly see numbers getting bigger, reaching milestones, and unlocking new content.

The DMI theming transforms generic idle mechanics into a cohesive business simulation experience. Each of the eight business units represents a real product line (core drilling, blade manufacturing, grinding wheels, specialty bits, mining equipment, distribution, R&D, and diamond mines), educating players about DMI's offerings while they play. The progression from garage workshop to global empire mirrors real business growth narratives, and the unlockable environments (garage → workshop → factory → HQ → towers → empire) provide powerful visual feedback for player advancement. The manager system introduces collectible characters with personalities, while the prestige system creates meaningful long-term goals through the "angel investor" mechanic.

Technically, idle games are ideal for mobile/web platforms due to their passive nature—players can check in briefly throughout the day to collect earnings and make purchases, then leave the game running in the background. Phaser 3's robust state management and local storage capabilities make saving progress seamless, while the BigNumber.js library (or similar) handles the astronomical numbers that idle games require (quadrillions, quintillions, and beyond). The game can function as a progressive web app with cloud sync for cross-device play, and the monetization model follows proven idle game strategies: optional premium currency for convenience boosts, cosmetic upgrades, and ad removal. Diamond Empire: DMI Tycoon leverages the psychological appeal of exponential growth and number-go-up gameplay while continuously reinforcing DMI's brand through every business unit, upgrade, and milestone achieved.
